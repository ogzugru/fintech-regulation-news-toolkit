# Technical Milestones

## Milestone 1: Project Setup & Architectural Design
- **Tasks:**
    - Define project requirements and scope.
    - Establish the hexagonal architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles.
    - Select technologies (Spring Boot, Spring AI, govinfo API, etc.) and plan the project structure.
    - Set up initial documentation, repository, and project skeleton.
- **Deliverables:**
    - Architectural diagrams and technical documentation.
    - A basic project structure with a Git repository.

## Milestone 2: Domain & Core Business Logic Implementation
- **Tasks:**
    - Create domain models (e.g., the Regulation entity and analysis result attributes).
    - Develop core business logic and service interfaces (e.g., `RegulationAnalysisService`).
    - Implement initial business rules and analysis algorithms.
- **Deliverables:**
    - Core domain layer classes and interfaces.
    - Basic unit tests to verify the business logic.

## Milestone 3: GovInfo API Integration
- **Tasks:**
    - Implement the GovInfo API adapter (i.e., `RegulationDataProvider`).
    - Configure API endpoints, authentication (API keys), and error handling.
    - Write tests (mock and integration tests) for the API adapter.
- **Deliverables:**
    - Functioning API adapter that fetches regulation data from govinfo.
    - Successful test cases for data retrieval.

## Milestone 4: Spring AI Integration & Analysis Module Development
- **Tasks:**
    - Integrate Spring AI by implementing the `SpringAIAnalysisAdapter`.
    - Develop core analysis functionalities (e.g., sentiment analysis, summarization).
    - Integrate AI results into the domain model.
    - Experiment with and validate different AI models if needed.
- **Deliverables:**
    - A working AI analysis module with simulated or real results.
    - Unit tests verifying the AI analysis functionality.

## Milestone 5: REST API & External Service Integration
- **Tasks:**
    - Develop REST controllers to expose the analyzed regulation data (e.g., `/regulations` endpoint).
    - Integrate with additional external services if necessary (e.g., logging, monitoring).
    - Implement error handling, security, and logging mechanisms.
- **Deliverables:**
    - Fully functional REST API endpoints.
    - Integration tests confirming end-to-end functionality.

## Milestone 6: Testing & Continuous Integration
- **Tasks:**
    - Write comprehensive unit tests (using JUnit, Mockito, etc.) for all components.
    - Develop integration tests covering key interactions between modules.
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing (using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.).
- **Deliverables:**
    - High test coverage across all modules.
    - Automated test runs in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Milestone 7: Documentation & Sample Application
- **Tasks:**
    - Create detailed API documentation (using Swagger/OpenAPI) and usage guides.
    - Write developer guides detailing the project structure, architectural decisions, and integration examples.
    - Provide a sample application or code snippets to demonstrate how to use the toolkit.
- **Deliverables:**
    - Comprehensive project and API documentation.
    - Example projects or code samples for easier integration.

## Milestone 8: Final Review & Release Preparation
- **Tasks:**
    - Perform final code reviews, refactoring, and performance optimizations.
    - Conduct final testing (including load and security tests) before release.
    - Prepare the repository for open source release (changelog, versioning, and release notes).
- **Deliverables:**
    - A stable, production-ready release version.
    - Published project on GitHub with complete documentation and release notes.
